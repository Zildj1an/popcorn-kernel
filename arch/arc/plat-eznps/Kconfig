menuconfig ARC_PLAT_EZNPS
	bool "\"EZchip\" ARC dev platform"
	select ARC_HAS_COH_CACHES if SMP
	select CPU_BIG_ENDIAN
	select EZCHIP_NPS_MANAGEMENT_ENET if ETHERNET
	select HAVE_CONTEXT_TRACKING
	select HAVE_VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_GEN
	help
	  Support for EZchip development platforms,
	  based on ARC700 cores.
	  We handle few flavours:
	    - Hardware Emulator AKA HE which is FPGA based chasis
	    - Simulator based on MetaWare nSIM
	    - NPS400 chip based on ASIC

config EZNPS_MTM_EXT
	bool "ARC-EZchip MTM Extensions"
	select CPUMASK_OFFSTACK
	depends on SMP
	default y
	help
	  Here we add new hierarchy for CPUs topology.
	  We got:
		Core
		Thread
	  At the new thread level each CPU represent one HW thread.
	  At highest hierarchy each core contain 16 threads,
	  any of them seem like CPU from Linux point of view.
	  All threads within same core share the execution unit of the
	  core and HW scheduler round robin between them.

config EZNPS_SHARED_TIMER
	bool "ARC-EZchip Shared Timer Support"
	depends on EZNPS_MTM_EXT
	default y
	help
	  Support for one HW timer per core.
	  This means all threads on single core will
	  Share the same HW timer. 

config EZNPS_HAS_SCHD_WFT
	bool "inst: schd.wft (schd and wait for interrupt)"
	depends on EZNPS_MTM_EXT
	default y
